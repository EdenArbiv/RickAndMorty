# RickandMortyAPI
In the project I used React for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend- Make API calls from Node with Axios, and display the results on React.
for the design I used the Material-UI library and a little styled component, Inside the home page there is a search button that allows you to search according to the type and your search value. In addition, there is a change values button which is only found in Rick Sanchez Card, and from there you can change the values you want.
For this I used Redux.
